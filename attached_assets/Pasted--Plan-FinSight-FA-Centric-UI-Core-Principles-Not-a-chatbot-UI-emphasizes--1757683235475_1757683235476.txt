# 🌟 Plan: FinSight FA-Centric UI

## 🎯 Core Principles

* **Not a chatbot** → UI emphasizes **search, discovery, and structured answers**, not chat bubbles.
* **Advisor-first design** → financial advisors need **clarity, trust, auditability, and low friction**.
* **Context clarity** → accounts + timeframe always visible; answers carry **as-of timestamps**.
* **One-click insights** → smart defaults, minimal typing, fast follow-ups.
* **Consistency** → standard layouts for answers (KPIs → charts → tables).

## 🛠️ Information Architecture

### 1. **Top Navigation Bar**

* Left: FinSight logo + app name.
* Center: **Search Box (Perplexity-style)**.
* Right: Account context switcher + timeframe picker.

### 2. **Search & Discovery (Entry Point)**

* Compact search box → expands on focus.
* Expanded overlay includes:

  * **Categories** (Comparison, Holdings, Risk, Attribution vs SP500, Activity, Allocation).
  * **Suggested Questions** (based on popularity/recent use).
  * **Pinned/Recent** (quick access).
* Freeform entry allowed; if no match, system captures the query for backend curation.

### 3. **Answer Canvas**

* Each answer renders as a **card** (not a chat bubble).
* Card structure:

  1. **Header**: Question text, account/timeframe chips, “As of {date}” badge.
  2. **Body**: Ordered blocks → paragraph → KPIs → charts → tables.
  3. **Footer**: Related/follow-up questions.
* Multiple answers stack vertically in scroll view.
* History drawer (right-hand panel) shows past Q\&A runs with exact context snapshots.

### 4. **Context Controls (Persistent Bar)**

* Always visible under the search bar:

  * **Accounts**: chips for selected accounts, color-coded.
  * **Timeframe**: YTD, 1M, 1Y, Previous Quarter, etc.
* Changes to context do not reset state; FAs can re-run answers in the new context.

## 📊 Answer Experience

* **Blocks from backend JSON** are rendered deterministically:

  * `paragraph` → text block (markdown-style).
  * `chart` → interactive chart with consistent palette & tooltips.
  * `table` → sortable, scrollable table with header type formatting (currency, %, symbol).
* **Standard layout** ensures answers feel like analyst reports, not chat responses.
* **Loading State**: skeleton charts/tables + rotating “system thinking” text (e.g., “Collating portfolio metrics…”).
* **Error State**: clear retry and refine options.

---

## 🔁 Follow-up Questions

* Displayed as chips/cards under each answer.
* If placeholders exist, show **inline quick-pills** (e.g., default benchmark).
* One tap executes immediately; chevron/expand opens parameter editor.
* Keeps the FA in flow: guided next steps without retyping.

---

## 📜 History & Auditability

* **History drawer** accessible via sidebar or shortcut.
* Each entry stores:

  * Entered vs Interpreted question.
  * Accounts + timeframe snapshot.
  * Placeholders resolved (incl. defaults used).
  * As-of timestamp + data version.
* Entries marked **Stale** when backend signals updated data.
* Deep-links: `/answers/{id}` restores the snapshot.
* Export to PDF/CSV with as-of + parameters in footer for compliance.

---

## ⚡ Interaction Model

* **Search box**: `/` to focus, ↑/↓ to navigate suggestions, Enter to run.
* **Context bar**: quick multi-select for accounts; timeframe presets.
* **One-click ask**: backend defaults fill placeholders when possible → FA gets instant answer.
* **Refine later**: each answer has a **Refine Parameters** button to adjust after the fact.

---

## 🎨 Visual Style

* Clean **dashboard look**, not conversational UI.
* **Cards and panels** over chat bubbles.
* Color-coded account chips and neutral aggregate style.
* Consistent typography hierarchy: question header > KPI strip > chart/table.
* Dark mode + compact mode for power users.
* Responsive: side-by-side layout on desktop, stacked on mobile.

✅ **Summary**:
FinSight will deliver a **structured, FA-centric Q\&A interface** — closer to a Bloomberg-style analytical dashboard than a chatbot. Advisors type or select questions, get consistent analyst-style answers with as-of timestamps, and pivot instantly with context controls or follow-ups. The UI emphasizes **clarity, reproducibility, and speed** — making it **an insight tool, not a chat app**.
